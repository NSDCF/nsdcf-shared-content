Throughout the course of its history, the Norwin School District has fostered countless exceptional alumni. Amongst those, some have gone even further to extend their influence to deeply affect their communities, industries, their nation, and even the world

In honoring these alumni for their accomplishment, it is our hope that their stories of challenge and triumph alike will inspire current Norwin students as they seek to discover the paths their own lives might take after graduation.

The 2024 Class of Distinguished Alumni will be honored at our [Seventh Annual Knight of Distinguished Alumni](/distinguished-alumni/2024), to be hosted on May 23, 2024. Reservations will be accepted beginning April 1.
