In May 2024, the Norwin School District Community Foundation (NSDCF) facilitated the awarding of $164,734.00 in scholarship awards to Norwin High School students to assist them in furthering their education. This includes twenty-nine Foundation-facilitated scholarships providing 38 awards. With these latest awards, NSDCF is proud to announce that since 2007, over $1,158,135 in total scholarship awards.

The NSDCF manages scholarships on behalf of families or organizations desiring to memorialize a loved one and/or give back to the Norwin school community in appreciation for what they have received. The Foundation creates savings accounts or endowed investments to manage the donations received to provide an annual scholarship award plus continue to grow each fund so that it will be provided in perpetuity. 

For more information about Foundation-facilitated scholarships, including starting a new scholarship or contributing to an existing scholarship, please contact Lauren Steiner at steiner.lauren@norwinsd.org or call 724-861-3007.

You may also contribute to a Foundation-facilitated scholarship or program during the Annual Days of Giving that takes place during Homecoming Week each year. This year the Days of Giving will take place beginning Monday, September 23rd through Sunday, September 29th.
