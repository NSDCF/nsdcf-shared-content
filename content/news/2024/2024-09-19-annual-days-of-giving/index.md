Get ready for an exciting Homecoming Week at Norwin School District! Starting Monday, September 23rd, this week of celebration will feature the Athletic Hall of Fame Banquet, the highly anticipated Friday night football game against North Hills High School, and a special honoring of the Homecoming Court. The fun doesn’t stop there—don’t miss the annual Homecoming Parade on Saturday!

In addition to these festivities, the Norwin School District Community Foundation (NSDCF) invites you to participate in its Annual Days of Giving, a time when you can make a meaningful impact on your school community. This campaign offers a chance to contribute tax-deductible donations that support crucial school programs and scholarships for Norwin students.

While donations are appreciated year-round, the Days of Giving Campaign serves as NSDCF’s primary outreach for raising funds to benefit its initiatives. For 2024, the goal is to raise $15,000 to support the following important causes:

* *Student Scholarships* Your support will help us grow the Norwin Alumni & Friends Association's scholarships along with our smallest [scholarship endowments](/programs/scholarships/), ensuring that they continue to support Norwin graduates long into the future.
* *Educator Innovation Grants* Our [Educator Innovation Grants](/programs/) is a competitive grant process that awards start-up funds to Norwin teachers looking to innovate with new ideas to go beyond the basic curriculum and enhance student learning.
* *A+ Spaces* A re-envisioning of Norwin's existing STEM/STEAM programs, *A+ Spaces* supports upgrades to academic, arts, athletics, and activities facilities and programs. For more information, contact Lauren at

## Why Your Support Matters

Did you know that since its founding in 2007, NSDCF has facilitated over $1,158,134 in scholarship awards for Norwin High School students? And here’s the best part—everyone on the NSDCF Board of Directors serves as a volunteer! This means that the entirety of your donation (minus a small processing fee for PayPal donations) will go directly toward the scholarship or program you choose to support.
How to Contribute

You can direct your donation to any of the priorities listed above, or choose another program or scholarship facilitated by the Foundation. If you're unsure where to direct your contribution, the Foundation can allocate the funds where they’re needed most.

**Online Donations** To make a tax-deductible gift during the Annual Days of Giving, visit nsdcf.org/donate starting Monday, September 23rd through Sunday, September 29th.
**Mail-in Donations** Prefer to donate by check? Please mail your donation, payable to Norwin School District Community Foundation, to the following address: *NSDCF 281 McMahon Drive, North Huntingdon, PA 15642* If you’d like your donation to support a specific fund, be sure to include the name of that fund on the memo line of your check.

## Thank you for your Support

Your contribution, no matter the size, will have a lasting impact on Norwin students. Together, we can reach our $15,000 goal and continue to support the future of education and innovation in our community. Thank you for your generosity and commitment!
