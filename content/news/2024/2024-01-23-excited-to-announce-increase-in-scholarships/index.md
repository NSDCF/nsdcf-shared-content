We are excited to announce that the Norwin Alumni & Friends Association will now offer two $500 scholarships to graduating Norwin High school students who have been accepted to a college or trade school, and have at least one parent who is a Norwin graduate. The successful scholarship applicants will be those who show active and community service during their high school career.

In time, we hope to continue expanding the number of scholarships and the size of their awards. This is possible only thanks to the generous support of the Norwin community, businesses, and our members.

Applications may be downloaded below, or picked up in the Norwin High School Guidance Office. Completed applications are to be submitted to the Norwin High School Guidance Office on or before March 15, 2024:
