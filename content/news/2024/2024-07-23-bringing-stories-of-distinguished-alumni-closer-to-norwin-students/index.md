Those entering the Norwin High School through the auditorium entrance will find a new display honoring all of our Distinguished Alumni. Together with school visits from previous recipients, it is another opportunity to try and share their stories with current Norwin students. Through their stories, it is our hope that Norwin students will find inspiration as they prepare for the next chapter in their own stories.

This new display, which matches the Norwin Athletic Hall of Fame display, was made possible through the generous support of Kathy and Jim Duffy together with Cheryl and Casey Harper.
