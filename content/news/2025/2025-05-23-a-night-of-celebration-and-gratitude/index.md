These honorees are recognized not only for their personal and professional accomplishments, but also for the impact their stories have on today’s students. In the days leading up to each year’s event, several of our Distinguished Alumni visit Norwin schools to speak directly with students. They share their life journeys—their challenges, moments of perseverance, and successes—with the hope that these stories will inspire students as they begin thinking about their own futures beyond graduation.

The opportunity for students to hear from past graduates who once walked the same halls is invaluable and these conversations help students see the many paths open to them and remind them that even the most difficult challenges can become stepping stones to success. 

The Norwin Alumni & Friends Association, together with the Norwin School District Community Foundation, extends heartfelt thanks to the community for its support and for making this year’s event a memorable one. We could not be succesful without their support.
