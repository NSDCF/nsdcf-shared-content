On September 10, 2025, the Norwin Alumni and Friends Association (NAFA) and the Norwin School District Community Foundation (NSDCF) gathered with friends, families, and community partners at the Stratigos Banquet Centre for a very special evening—our Knight of Appreciation.

This year’s celebration carried added meaning: NAFA’s 10th Anniversary. For the past decade, NAFA has been advocating for Norwin alumni, supporting students, and investing in the future of the District. But none of this could have happened without you—the Norwin community. Every scholarship, every program, every success story has been built on the generosity, vision, and support of families, businesses, and friends who believe in Norwin.

The evening was more than a dinner—it was a reflection on what we’ve accomplished together and a reminder of the community spirit that makes Norwin special. Stories were shared, milestones were remembered, and gratitude was expressed for the countless ways people have contributed over the past ten years. It was clear throughout the night that NAFA and NSDCF are not just organizations—they are extensions of a community that takes pride in lifting up its students and celebrating its alumni.

During the evening, we honored:

* The Founding Members of NAFA, who saw the need for an alumni voice and made it reality.
* Our NSDCF Directors and NAFA Executive Committee volunteers, whose leadership and dedication guide these organizations.
* Families and businesses who provide annual scholarships—together, NSDCF has facilitated more than $1.35 million in awards since 2007, including NAFA’s own scholarships.
* Norwin’s administration, faculty, and staff, whose partnership empowers everything we do.
* Our many donors, sponsors, and event supporters, whose gifts and presence sustain us year after year.

The night was filled with heartfelt words from NAFA President Lynn Clark, NSDCF President Jack Boylan, and community members Bud Geissler and Leslie Quealy, who shared first-hand stories of how NSDCF scholarships have affected their lives and the lives of their children. Their words were heartfelt and powerful, a reminder of how important it is that we continue in our mission.

As we look back on 10 years of NAFA, one thing is clear: nothing we’ve accomplished could have happened without the Norwin community. Your support has turned ideas into action, and action into lasting change. Here’s to the past decade—and to the next one, which we will build together.
