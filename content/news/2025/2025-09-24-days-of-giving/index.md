It’s almost time for one of our favorite Norwin traditions--Homecoming Week, and with that, the Days of Giving 2025! Each year during Homecoming Week, the Norwin School District Community Foundation--the NSDCF--invites the entire Norwin community—alumni, families, friends, and neighbors—to come together in support of our students and schools. This year’s campaign runs from Monday, September 29, through Sunday, October 5, 2025, and we can’t wait to see the impact we’ll make together.

While donations are appreciated year-round, the Days of Giving Campaign serves as NSDCF’s primary outreach for raising funds to benefit its initiatives. For 2025, the goal is to raise $15,000 to support the following important causes:

* *Student Scholarships* Your support will help us grow the Norwin Alumni & Friends Association's scholarships along with our smallest [scholarship endowments](/programs/scholarships/) to provide greater assistance to recipients as they begin their post high school education. These scholarships provided awards in the range of $300-800 this past May but with the increased cost of higher education, students need additional support.
* *Educator Innovation Grants* Our [Educator Innovation Grants](/programs/) is a competitive grant process that awards start-up funds to Norwin teachers looking to innovate with new ideas to go beyond the basic curriculum and enhance student learning.
* *Norwin's A+ Facilities Program* A re-envisioning of Norwin's existing STEM/STEAM programs, *A+ Spaces* supports upgrades to academic, arts, athletics, and activities facilities and programs and helps ensure students and teachers have the facilities necessary to provide a first class learning experience.

Should you prefer, you may direct your donation to any of the above priorities or any other program managed by the Foundation or the Norwin Alumni & Friends Association, or permit the Foundation to make that designation for you. One hundred percent of your donation, less Paypal's small processing fee, will go to the funds you designate.

## Why Your Support Matters

Did you know that since its founding in 2007, NSDCF has facilitated over $1,158,134 in scholarship awards for Norwin High School students? And here’s the best part—everyone on the NSDCF Board of Directors serves as a volunteer! This means that the entirety of your donation (minus a small processing fee for PayPal donations) will go directly toward the scholarship or program you choose to support.
How to Contribute

You can direct your donation to any of the priorities listed above, or choose another program or scholarship facilitated by the Foundation. If you're unsure where to direct your contribution, the Foundation can allocate the funds where they’re needed most.
